# tic-tac-toe

This application was designed based on https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html which provides guidance to develop it, however I have made some improvements such the use of toggle buttons to reverse buttons order, highlight checked squares and games' winner, and inform the location of each move. Additionally, I separated all the components in different files, organized and made minor changes on CSS.
